<b>HTML</b> stands for HyperText Markup Language.
<br>It is used to design web pages using a markup language.
<br><b>HTML</b> is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
<br>Hypertext defines the link between web pages.
<br>A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
<br>This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. 
<br>Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. 
<br>The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. <br>
